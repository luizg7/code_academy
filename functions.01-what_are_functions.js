/* In programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a function. A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task. */
